This project is focused on COVID-19 epidemic in Canada.

Main results can be viewed in the form of interactive presentation (presentation.html) or a static poster (poster.pdf)

The rest of the files is divided into three folders:
1) data - csv and json files used to prepare visualizations
2) plots - png and html files containing generated plots
3) scripts - python scripts used to generate plots
